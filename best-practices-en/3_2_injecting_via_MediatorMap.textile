h3(#mappingwithmediatormap). Injection Mapping with the MediatorMap Class

The MediatorMap class implements IMediatorMap, which provides two methods for mapping your mediators to views and registering them for injection.

<pre>mapView(viewClassOrName:*, mediatorClass:Class, injectViewAs:Class = null, autoCreate:Boolean = true, autoRemove:Boolean = true):void</pre>

*mapView* accepts a view class, MyAwesomeWidget, or a fully qualified class name for a view, _com.me.app.view.components::MyAwesomeWidget_ as the first parameter. The second parameter is the Mediator class that will mediate the view component. *[NEED TO PUT IN injectAsView]* The last two parameters autoCreate and autoRemove are boolean switches that provide convenient automatic mediator management.

<pre>//someplace in your application where mapping/configuration occurs
mediatorMap.mapView(MyAwesomeWidget, MyAwesomeWidgetMediator); </pre>

<pre>//somewhere inside of the contextView's display list
var myAwesomeWidget:MyAwesomeWidget = new MyAwesomeWidget();
this.addChild(myAwesomeWidget); //the ADDED_TO_STAGE event is dispatched, which triggers the view component to be mediated</pre>

This approach utilizes the automated mediation. Manual mediation, and a more in-depth look at this process will be covered later in the "Mediators":#mediators section.
